# Experimenting a civic engagment platfrom using chat-bots
## What is hawa-ko-reporter?
hawa-ko-reporter is a chat-bot that communicates the Air Quality parameters in ‘human language’, including the future forecast. It also prompts the precautionary actions users can take and checks if the users did so. We will make use of available real-time data and apply the Machine Learning algorithms for forecasts. The feedback loop in itself will be another piece of data that will provide further insights.
